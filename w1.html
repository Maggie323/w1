	<h1>What Issues Does Responsive Web Design Solve?</h1>

<!--Paragraph Section-->
	<p>Responsive Web Designs provides a good user experience across different electronic devices without compromising on the quality of the content. </p>
	<p>RWD can solve picture sizing issues, and apply appealing picture sizes appropriate to the screen size of various devices. For example, it wouldn’t be a good website if a picture takes up a large amount of screen space when viewing from a mobile device. </p>	
	<p>RWD can also solve overlapping issues. For example, a responsive website should display its content in different screen sizes without having text or images overlap with each other, but instead display its content appropriate to screen sizes. </p>
	<p>I believe that a responsive website may also solve low visitor ratings. Considering that there are many more people now surfing the web via smartphones (or other small devices), a user might not spend much time on a website that isn’t responsive on the small device being used. Those such websites might receive less visitors than websites that are responsive across various electronic devices.</p>
